Problem Statement
Given an array of student objects and 5 functions in the script.js file, write code to perform the following tasks.

Array of student objects
[{id:1,name:"john",age:"18",marks:80}, {id:2, name:"jack",age:"20", marks:85}, {id:3, name:"karen", age:"19",marks:35} ]

Tasks
`PrintStudentbyMap()`: console.log all students with marks over 50 using the `.map` function.
`PrintStudentbyForEach()`: console.log all the students who have marks over 50 using the `.forEach` function.
`addData()`: In this function, create another student object and append it to the array. For example, push this in the array - `{id:4,name:"susan",age:"20",marks:45}` and then console.log it.
`removeFailedStudent()`: In this function, remove the student who has failed, i.e. with less than 50 marks. console.log the changed array.
`ConcatenateArray()`: Create another array with 3 student objects similar to the one in the given array but with different ids and all other parameters.

Guidelines
Clone the given Github repository and edit the `script.js` file only. Write concise and efficient code.
Please ensure that you always update the parent array and not create a new one.
